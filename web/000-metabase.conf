# NOTE: You can use https://certbot.eff.org/ to get a free ssl certificate - very nice!!
    # Do not allow it to redirect all traffic - doing so overwrites the this config file.
    # Instead,
        # uncomment the following Rewrite statements to force all traffic to https.
        # change YOUR.URL.COM to your url you wish to use for https
# RewriteEngine on
# RewriteCond %{SERVER_NAME} =localhost [OR]
# RewriteCond %{SERVER_NAME} =YOUR.URL.COM
# RewriteRule ^ https://%{SERVER_NAME}%{REQUEST_URI} [END,NE,R=permanent]
